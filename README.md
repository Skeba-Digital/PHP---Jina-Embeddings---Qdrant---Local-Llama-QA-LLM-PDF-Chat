# NodeCodeStudio - Jina Embeddings + Qdrant + Local Llama QA

This is an interactive web-based application designed to:
- Upload, process, and manage document files (e.g., PDFs and text files).
- Embed document data using Jina embeddings.
- Store and query embeddings via Qdrant for efficient retrieval.
- Answer user queries based on document context using a locally hosted Llama model.

The application leverages PHP backend endpoints and JavaScript for front-end functionality. This README provides a guide for setting up and using the application.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A web server capable of running PHP.
- Qdrant for vector storage and retrieval.
- A local Llama model endpoint for QA (optional).

### Installation
Clone the repository:
   ```bash
1.   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NodeCodeStudio.git
2. Set up your web server to serve the `index.html` file.

3. Deploy the PHP backend endpoints on your server. These include:
   - `list_documents.php`
   - `upload_chunks.php`
   - `embeddings.php`
   - `search_chunks.php`

4. Ensure Qdrant is running and accessible for storing and querying vector embeddings.

5. *(Optional)* Set up your local Llama model endpoint and ensure itâ€™s accessible.
